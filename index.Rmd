# Preliminary remarks {-}

This is a web complement to MATH 341 (Linear Models), a first regression course for EPFL mathematicians.


We shall use the **R** programming language througout the course (as it is free and it is used in other statistics courses at EPFL). Visit [the R-project website](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download the program. The most popular graphical cross-platform front-end is [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

**R** is an object-oriented interpreted language. It differs from usual programming languages in that it is designed for interactive analyses. 


Since **R** is not a conventional programming language, my teaching approach will be learning-by-doing. The benefit of using *Rmarkdown* is that you see the output directly and you can also copy the code.
